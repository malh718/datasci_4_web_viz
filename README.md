# Working with Shiny for R
https://ncanrv-maliha-hossain.shinyapps.io/project/

Challenges: There were a number of challenges I had encountered while running this application. The first one was loading in the csv properly. That had to be completed by right clicking and choosing set working directory. Once that was properly loaded in, another issue that I had run into was that when I had deployed the app it said it would not work unless the file was in app.R whereas my file was untitled. Once that was renamed and fixed the application deployed and is running.

Challenges: 
For some reason, when I was loading up by shin.py file, from was underlined and was not going running properly. I thought I had installed shiny properly, but once I had renamed by files and made sure to put by dataset in the shiny file, it had ran. I had to cd into the proper files such as the datsci_4_web_viz and then to shin.py, and from there did shiny ryn shin.py and set the ort to 8,000 and it ran properly and my visualizations were there.

Everything worked accordingly, however I stopped and restarted and it said my port was already in use and to restart with a new port, however when I refreshed the link that I had that showed Binge Drinking Age-adjusted Prevalence in Delaware by County, it was populating properly and working so I left it.
